# PTFE Release v201808-1

## CHANGELOG
APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added a system email when a site admin is removed. This email is sent to all remaining site admins.
1. Added settings that allow site admins to configure API rate limiting. By default, API rate limiting is enabled and limits clients to making 30 requests per second. However, by visiting the site admin and navigating to general settings, the global rate limit can be raised or disabled entirely. Due to the number of API requests Terraform Enterprise makes with regular use, the rate limit cannot be set lower than the default value of 30 requests per second. 
1. Added a download button for SAML metadata to the admin settings. An XML file is downloaded that can be imported into an identity provider.
1. Changed link to module status page to always display if any module versions had ingress errors, instead of only when the latest version had ingress errors.
1. Changed organization dropdown to simplify it. Organization settings are now linked at the top level.
1. Changed webpage page titles for all pages to be unique.
1. Added URL validation, to help prevent typos when adding VCS providers or setting up SAML authentication. 
1. Added ability to create state versions for a workspace using the v2 API. See API documentation for details. 
1. Added current state version as a relationship to workspaces in the API. See API documentation for details. 
1. Changed run comments design to make them more prominent. 
1. Changed the workspace "working directory" setting to be available even if no VCS integration is being used. 
1. Added a new site admin setting that allows customization of the support@hashicorp.com email address.
1. Added confirmation step before regenerating or deleting API tokens, and before deleting SSH keys.
1. Added "speculative" as a boolean attribute when creating configuration-versions via the API in order to trigger plan only runs. See the API documentation for details.
1. Removed plan state versions output in the UI when there are no state versions for a run. 
1. Added enhanced error reporting for Sentinel policy checks. A policy check that encountered multiple evaluation errors will now have all errors displayed in the policy check error output.
1. Added the ability to use the types standard library import with Sentinel policy checks. 
1. Parse summary metadata from `terraform plan` output 
1. Add support for the new Remote backend; this requires Terraform 0.11.8.

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed a sporadically displaying error message when successfully queueing a plan. 
1. Fixed an issue where applies that take longer than 3 hours would fail to upload their state when finished. Applies will still time out after 24 hours. 
1. Fixed issue where the apply or plan logs were blank for the current run. 
1. Fixed an issue that prevented Bitbucket Cloud commits from getting Terraform plan status updates. 
1. Fixed an issue with pull request runs being initiated regardless of the branch the workspace is tracking.
1. Fixed spacing on "clear filters" icon in Safari. 
1. Fixed an issue that caused malformed GitLab commit URLs.

1. Fixed an issue with missing SAML settings during migration. 
1. Improved postgresql container startup orchestration 
1. Fixed a bug in the Run state machine when certain transitions fail.
1. Fixed an issue where policy checked runs would transition before confirmation.
1. Fixed an issue that could cause Sentinel policy checks to hang when a configuration uses a module where all provider blocks in the module have aliases assigned to them. 
1. Fixed state truncation issue when Terraform dumps an "errored.tfstate" file. 

APPLICATION API BREAKING CHANGES:

1. Removed two-factor settings and recovery codes from API calls with an API token. They can now only be accessed with an active session. 

APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Purify module README Markdown before rendering.
