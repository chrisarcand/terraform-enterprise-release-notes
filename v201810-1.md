# PTFE Release v201810-1


APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. Changed the Users route from expecting a username to an external_id, aligning it with JSON API.

APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added a new access level named "plan" when granting a team access to a workspace. This new level includes all permissions in the "read" access level, but also allows users to queue a new run.
1. Added the ability to specify an associated run when creating a state version via API.
1. Changed workspace variables editor to edit a single variable at a time, improved keyboard support.
1. Submit build statuses to VCS providers for policy checks.
1. Added a beta checkbox to the Terraform version settings in the admin panel.
1. Changed the visibility of beta Terraform versions for organizations. Organizations can be granted beta Terraform version access from the site admin panel.
1. Added timestamps to state versions created by plans and applies.
1. Added API for creating a new module in the Module Registry without a backing VCS.
1. Changed the Sentinel runtime to the current release of 0.4.0. This includes fixes to negative index lookups, the addition of month_name and weekday_name values to the time import's timespace type, and the introduction of type conversion for booleans. For more details, contact technical support.

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed various organization, workspce, and user settings UI issues to improve consistency and layout.
1. Fixed an issue with workspaces tracking the latest Terraform version returning "disabled" versions.
1. Fixed a possible ingress issue when using a Bitbucket VCS
1. Improved performance of looking up Runs by ID in the admin interface.
1. Fixed incorrect setting of a workspace's current run. Creating a new run when a workspace's current run is in a final state will now result in the new run being set as the workspace's current run.
1. Fixed the states API to search for an organization case-insensitively.
1. Fixed auto-apply for organizations with mandatory 2FA.
1. Changed run status labels to clarify runs which require a user decision.
1. Fixed workspace admin permissions to delete workspaces.
1. Fixed a race condition which caused some runs to become stuck in "pending" state.
1. Changed the Run state `plan_only_finished` to `planned_and_finished` in the API, allowing it to act as the final state for "No Change" runs as well as PR-generated "plan only" runs.
1. Changed Runs which complete the "Planning" stage with "No Changes" to show "Planned" as their final status in the UI.
1. Fixed workspace "Needs Attention" filters: add policy check soft failures, remove planned with no changes.
