# PTFE Release v201812-1


APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added policy sets, which allow users to group policies and enforce them on specific workspaces.
1. Changed run details page to use a more compact layout, so that you can quickly see the status of your run.
1. Added current run section to workspace runs index, removed current run page.
1. Added full state output to state version detail page, in addition to diff from previous state.
1. Changed behavior of viewing raw logs for plans, policy checks, and applies to download instead of display, and use human-readable file names.
1. Added breadcrumb trail throughout the application to help with navigation.
1. Added user database ID to admin user page.
1. Added response headers with rate limit information.
1. Added workspaces force-unlock endpoint, which unlocks the workspace no matter who holds the workspace lock.
1. Changed the Run API to correctly differentiate runs which were created by Terraform.
1. Added the failure/success of Sentinel policy checks to their runs' VCS build statuses
1. Changed Runs to now process policy checks even if a Plan has no changes.
1. Added the ability to disable team membership management via SAML responses. If disabled, team membership must be managed by Terraform Enterprise.
1. Added more information about users' 2FA settings in the admin UI.
1. Added `workspace.id` to the workspace settings page for easier copying
1. Added an API endpoint to allow modification of VCS providers

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed the "latest change" column in the workspaces list to always reflect the last time the workspace state changed.
1. Fixed missing username and avatar for state versions uploaded through the API.
1. Fixed deleting a VCS-connected workspace when the VCS webhook cannot be deleted in BitBucket and Gitlab. This also prevents the data inconsistency where a run would get partially deleted and have a missing plan record or missing configuration version record.
1. Fixed an issue where policy checks would fail when an organization has a large amount of policies (approx. 25) policies configured at the same time.
1. Added support for reserved words as selector expressions in Sentinel. This means that selectors such as `tfplan.resources.foo.bar[0].applied.rule` will no longer produce an error.
1. Changed some of the logging output to go from Stderr to Stdout

APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Fixed a potential DoS vector where users could exploit policy uploads.

INSTALLER BUG FIXES:

1. Resolved issue with using ports for metrics services also used by some customers
