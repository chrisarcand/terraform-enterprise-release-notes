# PTFE Release v201809-1

## CHANGELOG

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. Changed the way resources and data sources are namespaced for Sentinel policy checks. All data sources are now present in the new `data` namespace in all imports, separate from the `resources` namespace where they used to reside. 
1. Changed the TerraformVersions Admin API to expect `external_id` instead of version, aligning it with other API routes. 
1. Increase the number of workspaces returned per-page for API requests to 150. (Other resources continue to default to 20.) 

APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added the ability to comment on a run without approving or discarding the plan or apply. 
1. Added run information to state version summary. 
1. Improved display of multi-line commit messages. 
1. Improved visual disambiguation of plan-only (speculative) runs.
1. Changed run page so that plan, policy check, and apply logs are expanded by default depending on the state of the run. 
1. Added a feature to display the titles and bodies of pull requests that trigger runs in workspaces.
1. Added the number of resources that would be added, changed, or destroyed as reported by Terraform plans. These numbers can be retrieved via the API for `plan` objects, and are also displayed in the UI while viewing a run's timeline. Finally, these numbers will also be reported to VCS providers in commit statuses for pull requests. 
1. Added a summary of the resources added, changed, or destroyed by applying a run. This call-out appears below the apply's log whether or not that log is collapsed. 
1. Add `created-at` attribute to vars API responses.
1. Added a check to verify the repository has files when creating or updating a VCS-connected workspace.

APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed a bug in the run state machine when certain transitions fail.
1. Fixed an issue where policy checked runs would transition before confirmation.
1. Fixed issue where private module registry module dependencies and resources were not listed.
1. Fixed the error message when a workspace name is already taken.
1. Security: Fixed XSS exploit in private module registry README rendering.
1. Fixed avatar and user link for the first ingressed configuration version when using GitHub or Bitbucket Cloud.
1. Fixed an issue where a workspace could not be updated if the repository was renamed in Bitbucket Server. 
1. Fixed page layout issue if avatar images fail to load. 
1. Fixed an issue where deleting an organization would not remove that organization's modules from the private module registry.
1. Fixed page layout issue with long organization names.
1. Fixed an issue in the Admin API where attempting to destroy a Terraform Version that is in use or an official release would raise an internal server error. A validation error is now shown instead. 
1. Fixed admin impersonation UI to prevent attempting to impersonate yourself or service accounts.
1. Fixed the plan-only runs' status to show as "Planned" instead of "Needs confirmation" 
1. Fixed delete workspace button in site admin. 
1. Fixed timestamp on canceled plans and applies, which previously always showed "a few seconds ago".
1. Fixed an "invalid date" error that appeared when viewing Sentinel policies that had not yet been populated with data.
1. Fixed UI failing to load in Internet Explorer 11.
1. Fixed issue with icon rendering on Microsoft Edge. 
1. Fixed an issue where policy checks on plan-only runs appeared to be overridable. 
1. Fixed an issue where a generic 500 error was returned when creating a Sentinel policy with an invalid configuration. Attempting to do so will now properly return a 422 with information about why the configuration is invalid. 
1. Fixed issue where the user was incorrectly prompted to "Discard" plan-only runs.
1. Fixed an issue where an unconfigured (empty) Sentinel policy would cause other, configured policies not to be checked during a run. 
1. Fixed an issue with workspaces tracking the latest Terraform version returning disabled versions.
1. Fixed: order Terraform versions in site admin by version. 
1. Fixed issues that resulted in Terraform 0.11.8 being incompatible with previous releases. Terraform 0.11.8 is compatible with this release.

INSTALLER LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added ability for users to specify their own at-rest encryption password.
