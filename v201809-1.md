# PTFE Release v201809-1

## CHANGELOG

APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. Changed the way resources and data sources are namespaced for Sentinel policy checks. All data sources are now present in the new `data` namespace in all imports, separate from the `resources` namespace where they used to reside. -- @vancluever [hashicorp/tfe-sentinel-worker#16](https://github.com/hashicorp/tfe-sentinel-worker/pull/16)
1. Changed the TerraformVersions Admin API to expect `external_id` instead of version, aligning it with other API routes. -- @caseylang [hashicorp/atlas#6696](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6696)
1. Increase the number of workspaces returned per-page for API requests to 150. (Other resources continue to default to 20.) -- @beekus [hashicorp/atlas#6763](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6763)

APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added the ability to comment on a run without approving or discarding the plan or apply. -- @alisdair [hashicorp/atlas#6613](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6613)
1. Added run information to state version summary. -- @thrashr888 [hashicorp/atlas#6604](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6604)
1. Improved display of multi-line commit messages. -- @thrashr888 [hashicorp/atlas#6605](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6605)
1. Improved visual disambiguation of plan-only (speculative) runs. -- @thrashr888 [hashicorp/atlas#6603](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6603)
1. Changed run page so that plan, policy check, and apply logs are expanded by default depending on the state of the run. -- @alisdair [hashicorp/atlas#6664](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6664)
1. Added a feature to display the titles and bodies of pull requests that trigger runs in workspaces. -- @davidcelis [hashicorp/atlas#6702](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6702)
1. Added the number of resources that would be added, changed, or destroyed as reported by Terraform plans. These numbers can be retrieved via the API for `plan` objects, and are also displayed in the UI while viewing a run's timeline. Finally, these numbers will also be reported to VCS providers in commit statuses for pull requests. -- @davidcelis [hashicorp/atlas#6732](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6732)
1. Added a summary of the resources added, changed, or destroyed by applying a run. This call-out appears below the apply's log whether or not that log is collapsed. -- @thrashr888 [hashicorp/atlas#6657](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6657) -- @davidcelis [hashicorp/atlas#6744](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6744)
1. Add `created-at` attribute to vars API responses. -- @alisdair [hashicorp/atlas#6695](https://github.com/hashicorp/atlas/pull/6695)
