# PTFE Release v201901-1


 APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:



 APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added a configuration option that requires site admins have two-factor authentication enabled before they are able to use admin functions.
1. Changed the TFE UI to use the full long run ids instead of short ids.
1. Added the ability to edit the organization email in the UI.
1. Changed the organization creation API endpoint to allow session_timeout, session_remember, collaborator_auth_policy, and owners_team_saml_role_id attributes to be supplied.
1. Added a setting to workspaces to support queuing runs immediately on creation.
1. Organization tokens can now also destroy workspaces.
1. Added UI to allow admin users to force unlock workspaces.
1. Changed workspace page structure: split large settings page into individual pages, and use a dropdown for navigation.
1. Changed state version index page to fetch only relevant data, decreasing page load time by 50%.
1. Added workspace lock status to states page.
1. Added can-update-ssh-keys permissions flag to the Organizations API.
1. Changed workspace locking so that the user who has locked a workspace is the only user able to unlock a workspace. Admins are able to force-unlock a workspace through a new endpoint.
1. Changed API behavior when attempting to (un)lock and already (un)locked workspace: the API will now respond 409 Conflict instead of 200 OK.
1. Changed workspace lock behavior so that the workspace must be locked by the acting user when attempting to upload state via the v2 API.
1. Added ability to set limits on the number of organizations a user can create and the number of workspaces an organization can have.
1. Updated the email notice sent to admins when another admin has granted or revoked access to include the user's email address, along with details of the admin that performed the action.
1. Changed the Sentinel runtime to version 0.8.1. For the latest changes, see the [release notes](https://docs.hashicorp.com/sentinel/changelog#0-8-1-january-17-2019-).
1. Added the `outputs` namespace to the `tfconfig` Sentinel import, allowing output configuration to be checked during policy checks.
1. Added Terraform v0.11.11 to the default versions available in PTFE
1. Make errors JSON:API compliant by adding `detail`
1. Removed the X-Runtime header from API responses

 APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed an issue where Terraform Enterprise would not create webhooks on a repository that had been recently renamed.
1. Fixed an issue that would cause TFE to attempt to accept multiple results for a Sentinel policy check.
1. Fixed loading multiple policy check logs during "backscroll".
1. Changed 2FA setup to reload the app after verification to receive new permissions.
1. Changed the manner in which scheduled jobs are parsed for the TFE application workers. Scheduled jobs are parsed using the default timezone, UTC.
1. Fixed an internal server error caused by webhook requests without a signature.
1. Fixed rendering bug with the queue plan message dropdown.
1. Fixed visual bug where an empty run actions form would display for read-only users.
1. Added error handling for run page auto-refresh, so that a single network error won't stop it from refreshing.
1. Changed support link in footer to link to support.hashicorp.com
1. Small text updates for consistency and clarity


 APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:

1. Security: Closed a hole allowing speculative plans from pull requests originating from forked repositories, which could allow unauthorized users to run arbitrary commands via `terraform plan`.
1. Security: Corrected a situation where log messages created during VCS updates could possibly disclose API access tokens. Note that the logs in question are only available in the support bundle and are otherwise inaccessible under normal circumstances.
1. Security: Corrected a situation where Sentinel worker log messages could possibly disclose API access tokens. Note that the logs in question are only available in the support bundle and are otherwise inaccessible under normal circumstances.
