# PTFE Release v201804-1

## CHANGELOG

**APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:**

- GitLab is now supported as a source for Terraform modules. 
- When SAML SSO is enabled, the user session must have an active session to make API commands. The API token timeout may be set site-wide when SSO is enabled. 
- Remove the AuthContextClassRef element from the SAML SSO request so the identity provider's default AuthenticationMethod setting is used. 
- The username of a user can be specified for SAML SSO. 
- Add the ability to connect to SMTP without authentication. 
- We now enforce that ENV variable names conform to typical `bash` rules (beginning with a letter or underscore, and containing only alphanumerics and underscores) and that Terraform variable names only contain alphanumerics, underscores, and hyphens.
- Allow ecdsa (`EC`) and ed25519 (`OPENSSH`) private keys.
- Add an API and UI to allow organizations and users to mange their 2FA settings.
- Revoking a VCS connection or deleting a VCS client now requires confirmation. 
- When a workspace becomes unlinked from its VCS repository, an email is sent to the organization owners.
- Add ability to cancel in-progress plans and applies. 
- Workspaces can be created without a VCS connection in the UI.
- A workspace's VCS connection can be edited through the UI and API. 
- Configuration error messages are exposed in the UI and API.
- Rename workspace "Integrations" page to "Version Control" in UI.
- Rename organization "OAuth Configuration" page to "Version Control" in UI.
- Add Azure blob storage support. 

**APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:**

- Data cleanup is more reliable via HTTP retries and better exception handling.
- Fixes issue with registry modules that require deep cloning of git submodules. 
- Fixed an internal server error that prevented some workspaces from being created with specific repsitories. 
- Fixed inline error messages for form fields with multi word labels.
- Improved error messages in the API and UI when adding an OAuth client.
- Fixed UI layout widths for widescreen.
- The email address entered when a user forgot their password is no longer case sensitive.
- We now redirect back to the OAuth page with error message when there is a failure to connect the client. 
- The UI now clarifies that Bitbucket Server VCS connections require a private SSH key. 
- Fixed missing "Override & Continue" button for Sentinel soft-mandatory policy check failures. 
- Very long lines in statefile diffs are now wrapped in the UI.
- Flash notices in the UI now auto hide after 3 seconds, instead of 10. 
- Users are redirected to the v2 page they were trying to access after login. 
- Show an error message in the UI instead of a 500 error when an exception occurs while connecting an org oauth client to a VCS provider.
- Fix a data race that cause some runs to get stuck when using the "Run this plan now" feature. 

**APPLICATION API BREAKING CHANGES:**

- The Registry Modules creation API has changed. Instead of supplying `ingress-trigger-attributes`, supply a `vcs-repo` object. Additionally, instead of supplying a `linkable-repo-id`, supply a `vcs-repo.identifier` 
- The `linkable-repos` resource has been renamed to `authorized-repos`, so please use that phrase in API requests. 
- Requests which contain invalid `include` parameters will now return 400 as required by the JSON API spec. 

**APPLICATION LEVEL SECURITY FIXES:**

- Upgrade loofah gem to 2.2.1 to address CVE-2018-8048. 
- Upgrade rails-html-sanitizer to  1.0.3 to address CVE-2018-374.
