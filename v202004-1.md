# TFE Release v202004-1


APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:



 APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:
1. Added support for Sentinel remote policies and our new Sentinel foundational policies library
1. Added ability to manage team membership of invited users as well as API changes to allow adding and removing team members using their organization membership external ID.
1. Added the ability to configure request and assertion signing for SAML
1. The next-generation Sentinel imports (`tfconfig/v2`, `tfplan/v2`, and `tfstate/v2`) are now in general availability and are stable to use. For more information, see the release announcement: https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/terraform-sentinel-v2-imports-are-now-ga
1. Changed the structure of the low-level Sentinel data in policy check results. This only affects opaque, unstable parts of the [policy checks API](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/policy-checks.html). Any consumers of the `sentinel` field will need to adjust their implementations accordingly.
1. Added modules support for policy sets. Modules may now be defined within the root of a policy set by adding a `module` block to your `sentinel.hcl` file, with the relative path to the module as a `source` field within that block.
1. Added a user verification modal when Queueing a Destroy Plan for a given workspace.
1. Revamp of infrastructure destroy workflow which removed the CONFIRM_DESTROY variable in favor of a destroy protection setting. As a side effect, destroy protection is OFF by default for newly created workspaces to better support the CLI workflow.
1. Added redirect so that admins can access the site admin via `/admin`

 APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:
1. Fixed bug preventing runs from being queued from commit pushes for Bitbucket Server versions 5.4 - 5.13
