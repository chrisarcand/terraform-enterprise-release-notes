# TFE Release v202002-1


APPLICATION LEVEL BREAKING CHANGES:

1. In creating the new "Customizations" section for site admins, we also added a corresponding API for these options.  This means that the `support-email-address` is no longer available via the [General Settings APIs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/admin/settings.html#list-general-settings), but has been moved to the [new Customizations APIs](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/api/admin/settings.html#list-customization-settings).

 APPLICATION LEVEL FEATURES:

1. Added support for terraform login command.
1. Added Terraform version 0.12.20
1. Added ability to toggle cost-estimation providers
1. Added beta release of run triggers, which provide a way to connect a workspace to one or more source workspaces. These run trigger connections allow runs to queue automatically in a workspace on successful apply of runs in any of the source workspaces.
1. Added the new v2 Sentinel Terraform imports to mock generation. These are now included in the `sentinel-mock-bundle-v0` plan export type (the export type that gets used when you click the "Generate Sentinel mocks" button). They have a `-v2` suffix, example: `mock-tfplan-v2.sentinel`. The current, v1 imports are still included as their existing file names.
1. Added a pre-generated `sentinel.json` file to the Sentinel mock generation tarball. This can be used directly to immediately evaluate Sentinel policies against the generated mocks, and also as a reference to determine what import paths map to which mock file.
1. Added new customizations section for site admins


 APPLICATION LEVEL BUG FIXES:

1. Fixed an issue that caused cryptic errors when attempting to edit workspace settings if the OAuth VCS provider set up for the organization and workspace was deleted or had the connection revoked.
1. Fixed an issue with Azure DevOps Services when the project name contained spaces.
