# PTFE Release v201807-1

## CHANGELOG

# ADDITIONAL STEPS REQUIRED FOR ALL UPGRADING INSTALLS USING EXTERNAL SERVICES

**NOTE:** The parameters used to configure access to the PostgreSQL instance for an external services installation have changed. You must have your PostgreSQL connection information on hand to perform the upgrade.

Perform the following steps to properly upgrade:

* **BEFORE UPGRADING:** Retrieve PostgreSQL connection details and database credentials for reentry. These are available from the Settings screen before upgrading.
* After clicking Install, you will see an error starting the application similar to `container ... exited with non-zero`.
* Proceed to the Settings screen where you will need to re-enter the connection details (username, password, hostname and port, database name) in the settings screen.
* When asked if you wish to restart on the Settings screen, answer yes.
* The system will then begin booting properly.

Refer to the [Automated Installation guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/enterprise/private/automating-the-installer.html) for more details for performing automated installs.
